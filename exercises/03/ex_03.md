# Exercise 03

If you are using Windows, install GitBash from [http://gitforwindows.org/](http://gitforwindows.org/).
On the other hand, if using Mac/Linux, just use the existing Bash terminal.

By **only** using the Bash terminal, create a new folder where you copy
over your solution of the previous exercise, i.e. the `lesson02_solution.html` file.
Change the name of the file into `index.html`.
You will likely need to use Bash commands like 
`pwd`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `ls` and `cp`.

If you do not have it yet, install Docker on your machine.
If you are using Windows Home Edition, you might need to upgrade
it first (e.g., to Educational or Pro version).
If you are a student at Westerdals/Kristiania, you should be able 
to get free Windows upgrades. 

In the newly created folder with the html file, create a file
called `Dockerfile` by using `touch`.
Open such file in a text editor.
In such Dockerfile, configure it to use OS image from `httpd:2.4`.
This image contains an Apache Server.
Inside this Docker image, `COPY` your `index.html` file under the
folder `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/`.

From the folder with the `Dockerfile`, build this Docker image with:

`docker build -t foo .`


Run such Docker image with:

`docker run -p 80:80 foo`

If everything is correct, you should be able to open your browser
at the URL `localhost` and see your html page.
